16. the first run wizard should be really explanatory in order that the user understands everything, and sets up their own settings and everything before doing anything else. Make sure to make a nice, detailed wizard
17. no
18. i dont know if you can get the tags that the different wallpapers have originally on wallpaper engine on steam, but if not, then yes, every single wallpaper that is in the library should have tags by default. Make sure that it is seemlessly added, it doesnt freez the app or anything on the computer. Also make sure that the AI is quick and precise.
19. i want the users to be able to set their own keybinds, and also that the user can completely turn off, or delete the keybinds in the settings. Make sure that the keybinds are really easy to set up, and that the user can see all of the keybinds in the settings.
20. the search bar in the library should search for wallpapers that are inside the library, and the search in the workshop should search for wallpapers on steam workshop, that the user can download with a button, and then it will get added to the library as well. Make sure that the wallpapers in the library that are downloaded from steam workshop or wallpaper engine are using the wallpaper names, not the file names, and the images or videos that got imported should use the file names as the wallpaper names.
