1. it should keep playing, and then when the new wallpaper fully covers it, it should fully disappear. Make sure that when its a slideshow or something, it works the same way, so when the new wallpaper covers the last one, then the one that was there fully stops and disappears, and it doesnt keep playing under the new wallpaper. I think this might be the case sometimes, so make sure that never happens, no matter what, so in other words, there should never be two wallpapers above eachother at the same time.
2. yes
3. mute automatically when the window loses focus
4. Auto-remove from DB

21. no, the user can have the option to log in with their steam account, but i do not want to store any data. Anonymus download with steamCMD should be the default option, but the user can log in with their steam account to download wallpapers, and also the user can log out and then the app should stop downloading wallpapers. The user can also change the option to download wallpapers anonymously or with their steam account
22. yes, in the settings menu, or when the user goes to the workshop, and tries to search for wallpapers, but steam or steamcmd is not installed, then a prompt should pop up that downloads the them, or the user can copy the command to install it on the correct linux distro they have, so like if they have arch, then the aur helper should be used, and if they have ubuntu, then the apt package manager should be used, ect, ect.

32. single click should open the window. Also, i want you to update the tray icon with better options, like "Open Better Wallpaper", "Settings", if the user has the slideshow going, then a "Next Wallpaper", "Previous Wallpaper", ect, ect
33. if it reaches a specific ammount of ram, that the user can set in the settings, then the wallpaper just should go static, and in the tray icon, or the notifications for their system, it should show a notification that the slideshow has stopped due to high memory usage
34. yes
35. yes
36. yes, it should
37. yes
38.  iGPU for power, dGPU for heavy scenes
39. if the user is on hyprland, there should be a specific tab under "Monitors", where they can set specific wallpapers for each workspace, or group them, and different things like that, you know?
40. no, it just stay there, but get static, if its a video or gif or animated in any way, then it should just stay there as a static image

57. whichever is better
58. all of the most important features of the app
59. i dont know, whatever you feel like
60. i dont know what the licenses are or what to do with them, i want you to choose the best for the project
61. Hyprland-specific binds (e.g., bind = SUPER, W, exec, bwp next) 
62. Prompt the user to log in, and add a little explanation, or like a little questionmark icon, that tells the user that why do they have to log in to log in
63. display the first frame of the video, but do not play it
64. lets go with static, but the app has to remember these settings as well, that the user made
65. i would like more of a Setup Dialog type of thing.
